# Release Notes

## GALFITM

### galfitm-1.4.2

Fixed a few outstanding minor issues:

* Remove superfluous space from component extension names (fixes #138)
* Do not replace missing filenames (data, psf, badpix) with none. This avoids overflows when input tokens are smaller than 4 characters (fixes #139)
* Ignore S option and remove unnecessary blank lines. S option is included in GALAPAGOS feedmes, resulting in some output that is intended for interactive use. However, it is apparently deprecated in recent versions of galfit.
* Make some feedme options more resilient to float input (fixes #141)


### galfitm-1.4.1

Merge recent fixes from galfitm-1.2.x branch into 1.4.x branch. See galfitm-1.2.x notes below for details of these fixes and galfitm-1.4.0 for features added in the 1.4.x branch.


### galfitm-1.2.4

A small fix to ensure that ndof, chisq, etc. are consistently output whenever input data is provided.


### galfitm-1.2.3

Tiny update to prevent axial ratio from going below 0.01, in order to avoid artefacts. Previous (standard galfit) behaviour is a bit odd: if the axial ratio goes below 0 (i.e. negative), then it is "pushed back" to 0.05. However, if the steps are small enough, it is possible for the axial ratio to attain extremely small values.

It has been observed (by Boris) that for axial ratios well below 0.01 it is possible for artefacts to occur: what should be a narrow line becomes distinct 'blobs', apparently due to pixel aliasing. It is possible the flux normalisation may also be incorrect in such cases.

To avoid this issue, recognising that objects with axial ratios below 0.01 are almost certainly unphysical, the minimum axial ratio has been changed from zero to 0.01. To preserve usual galfit behaviour, we continue to "push back" the axial ratio to 0.05 when it goes below the 0.01 limit. 


### galfitm-1.2.2

This fixes a bug (identified by Boris) with chisq when run without fitting. This only occurs when the output file is created without any fitting [i.e. -o2 option or "P) 1” in feedme]. 

In previous versions of galfitm, the chisq, ndof and chi2nu that are reported in this case are calculated by a separate step (using chi2calc). In the conversion to multiband, this was neglected, such that the values for only one of the bands (whichever happens to comes last) are reported, rather than for all the bands combined.
    
This is fixed by this version: the chisq, ndof and chi2nu reported are those of all bands combined, in the same manner as done during the fitting process.
    
In addition, in case it is useful information, the chisq, ndof and chi2nu for each individual band are now captured and output in the 'BAND_INFO' table. These are also written to the headers of the corresponding model image extensions (note that this was already available in the non-fitting case, but changes behaviour in the case of fitting, as previously the same combined info was written to every header).


### galfitm-1.4.0

The main update in this release is the implementation of multi-band fitting
with the higher-order features introduced in GALFIT3: bending, fourier and
rotation isophotal distortions, in addition to boxiness. This allows
multi-band modelling of galaxy lopsidedness (e.g. Kruk et al. 2016), spiral
arms, etc. Basic functionality has been tested, but there may still be bugs.
Truncations probably still do not work.

There have also been a few additions to the non-parametric option.  You can
now tune the nonparam threshold and specify a radius for optional masking
of object centres in nonparam image.  There is also a 'nonparres' option to
output the full residual image.

Finally, a large (but as yet poorly documented) set of illustrations and
tests are available, providing many examples of how GALFITM may be used.


### galfitm-1.2.1

This version merges over bugfixes and small additional features from the 1.3.x development branch. These are generally related to the more experimental aspects of GALFITM.

1) Add -w command-line option to tailor output.
You can now override the 'W)' feedme option from the command line.
This is useful if you use 'W) none' to save space, but later want to
recreate the model image(s) and/or residuals.
   
2) Make -o[123] options work correctly.
These were not always outputting the correct images, they should be
now.

3) Implement the 'mask' output option
You can now chose to have the mask(s) included in the output fits file

4) Fix output of U) and V) options
In the output feedmes (e.g., *.galfit.01, etc.) these were comma
delimited, but should be space delimited. Using commas results in
incorrect behaviour!

5) Keep nonparam output images when appropriate.
Under some circumstances non-parametric images were being incorrectly
omitted from the output fits file.  They are now retained.

6) Be sure to replace existing file, rather than appending.
If the output fits file existed, under some circumstances it would be
appended to, rather than a new file being created.

7) Correct magnitudes of nonparam component.
If your input image has exposure time other than 1 sec, the nonparam
magnitudes were previously incorrect by a constant offset.

8) Fix MultiNest.
Using MultiNest was not working, but should be now (although still not
something for regular users to try).

9) Some others.
* Avoid some buffer overrun errors.
* Deal with 'bad' initial values a bit better.
* Set default exptime to 1sec as precaution.


### galfitm-1.2.0

This version includes a lot of changes since 1.1.12.  Backward compatibility should have been preserved, while adding features and flexibility.  However, due to changes merged in from standard galfit, fits performed using an internally-generated sigma image will give slightly different results to previous versions.  As usual galfitm is research software, and so should be used carefully and tested for your particular use case.  I have not labelled this a beta release, but one should be particulalrly attentive to the potential for bugs given the number of modifications made.  Please report any issues, ideally via the Google+ group.  The changes include:

1) Merging in the changes to standard galfit from version 3.0.2 to the current version 3.0.5.  The most significant aspects of this are:
   a) the self-generated sigma image is now smoothed with a Gaussian with sigma of 2 pixels;
   b) a flag string is included in the header and FIT_INFO fits table, which gives some codes for possible issues encountered;
   c) parameter values output to the screen or fit.log are highlighted with asterisks if they are potentially affected by convergence problems.

2) The corsair (v3) extension of galfit by Paolo Bonfini has been merged in.  This adds the core-Sersic (corser) model.  For further details, see http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~pbonfini/galfit-corsair/ Unlike the standard galfit-corsair version, it should be possible to specify constraints on all the corser parameters.

3) An additional (optional) line has been added to the feedme input file, labelled by 'W)'.  This can specify a series of output options, controlling what images and tables get put into the output fits file.  By default this behaves like standard galfit (psf images are no longer output by default).  However, one could chose to be complete or minimal, as desired.  One can also choose to output tables containing the parameter values at each iteration.

4) On the sigma image feedme line, labelled 'C)', one may include a value after the filename(s) [or none(s)].  This specifies the minimum value of any galfit-created sigma image, as a fraction of the sky-subtracted data flux in the corresponding pixel.  I.e. specifying '0.05' would create the sigma image as normal but then limit the minimum to 5% of the signal.  This may be useful for accounting for expected systematic wiggles in the light profile of galaxies, to avoid overfitting nuclei, spiral arm features, etc.

5) The output log/feedme file (usually written to galfit.01, etc.) now inherits the name of the output fits file (appended with galfit.01, etc.).  This contains the Chebyshev parameters, so is the most faithful way to restart a fit.  However, one may like to modify the band values, so a log/feedme file containing these is also output (the same name, but with .band appended).

6) Band values are now also output to the screen at the start of the fit, which makes verifying the input and spotting mistakes easier.

7) As before, a record of the fit parameters, chisq, etc. is output to fit.log.  This now contains details of all the bands.

8) Some of the screen output formatting has been tweaked.

9) The boxiness/diskiness parameter C0 appears to work now without crashing.

For details of how to use any new models or options, see the
EXAMPLE.GALFITM.INPUT file.


### galfitm-1.1.12

This version finally enables the position angle (PA) to wrap around the ends of the standard range (+-90, or +-180 if using Fourier modes, although they are still disabled for now).  Previously, if the initial PA value was on the other side of the range edge to the "true" value, then the fit may have become "stuck" (probably close to the boundary).  Now it will wrap around to the other side of the range.  This also works for wavelength-dependent PA, although here only the zeroth Chebyshev coefficient wraps (roughly the value at the average wavelength), and the values in each band are allowed to vary within the standard range centred on this reference value.

In reality this lack of wrapping was rarely an issue, e.g. for GALAPAGOS, as the initial PA tends to be close to the true value.  Note that in order for the wrapping to work, one must not specify additional soft constraints on PA.


### galfitm-1.1.11

This version fixes an intermittent segfault related to the constraints file, especially when using strong coupling between more than two components.


### galfitm-1.1.10

The bug described as fixed by galfitm-1.1.9 was only partly fixed.  There was a remaining mistake which could mean that the wring interpolation method was sometimes used.  This is now fixed and test show it is working as expected.  A more prominent warning is printed out in cases where the interpolation is approximate.


### galfitm-1.1.9

This release fixes a serious bug and adds a useful new feature.

The bug regards the initialization of the Chebychev coefficients in certain cases.  galfitm-1.1.8 addressed an issue with the numerical stability of the polynomial fits for large numbers of bands. Unfortunately it also inadvertently set polynomial fitting to be used where it should not.  The affected case is where the fitting order is less than the number of bands, but greater than one, and the specified initial parameter values do not lie on a polynomial of that order.

For example, one might be fitting 9 bands, but only allowing a particular parameter to vary as a quartic polynomial (corresponding to a fitflag value of 6 in the feedme file).  As input values, one might take the results of running SExtractor on the individual bands, which will not in general correspond to a quartic (5th-order) polynomial. Of course, this is a little contradictory (providing input values which do not match the desired function), but easily done and convenient.

In this case, galfitm must initialize a Chebyshev polynomial which approximates the input values.  In 1.1.8 this was done by first fitting a 9th-order polynomial and then using this to initialise a 5th-order Chebyshev polynomial.  However, the large wiggles typical when interpolating with a high-order polynomial mean that its value at the Chebyshev nodes bear little relation to the input function.  These nodes are used in the standard method of fitting a Chebyshev polynomial to a continuous function.  This causes the resulting Chebshev polynomial to be a bad (sometimes terrible) approximation to the input values.  Instead, previous versions, and now 1.1.9, use cspline interpolation, which is much smoother, and produces more reasonable results.  In future, these problems may be avoided by simply fitting a Chebyshev polynomial of specified order directly to the input values.

Note that this bug did not affect cases where full freedom was allowed (fitflag == number of bands), and neither did it affect cases with fixed (fitflag == 0), or constant (fitflag == 1) wavelength variation. In such situations, a full-order Chebyshev polynomial is initialized perfectly from the polynomial interpolation.

The new feature is the ability to use parameter constraints relative to the reference wavelength.  This means that one can specify that, say, the overall position of an object may vary, but that the positions in each image must lie within some distance of each other.


### galfitm-1.1.8

This fixes a serious problem which occurs in some cases.

When individual band values are given for a parameter, these are internally converted to Chebyshev coefficients by first fitting an interpolating function, and then using this to generate the CHebyshev coefficients.  When a polynomial interpolator is used, the result is perfect as Chebyshev functions are polynomials.

However, it was discovered that polynomial interpolation is unstable and introduces large errors for high orders.  For this reason, in galfitm-1.1.3 and subsequent versions, the cspline interpolator was used instead.  This has a serious disadvantage that the resulting Chebyshev function does not perfectly interpolate the input band parameter values.  When freedom is allowed for the function will vary during the fit, this will rarely cause significant problems.  However, when the function is held fixed (fitflag = 0) or only allowed to vary by a constant (fitflag = 1), the inaccuracies could have serious consequences.

Brief testing suggests that polynomial interpolation is stable up to n~30, so now cspline interpolation is only used when nbands >=30.  A warning message is printed in this case, as the introduced inaccuracies remain an issue here.  You should check the output.  For example, if you wish to specify individual sky values for nbands >=30, these will not be perfectly reproduced by the model.  Perhaps, in this situation, one could subtract the sky from each image before fitting, allowing the sky to be simply fixed to zero in the feedme file.


### galfitm-1.1.7

Workaround for highly masked multi-band data.

It was discovered that if a large fraction of an image (or more) is masked, but a large amount of freedom is given to the model, the covariance matrix is singular, resulting in a bomb at the end of fitting.  Experimentation has shown that including an extremely small additional factor in the diagonal of the covariance matrix prevents the crash.  I'm not entirely happy doing this, but it is probably better than a crash.

Note that this issue doesn't directly affect the parameter values themselves, just their errors, which should be treated with even more scepticism than usual.  However, this is a sign that the fit is not well constrained, with multiple sets of Chebyshev coefficients able to fit the data equally well.  The actual parameter values may still be meaningful (with effectively full freedom to vary with wavelength). However, I can't be sure they are reliable without further testing. Anyone using data in which large fractions of some of the images are masked is strongly advised to check the effect this has on the parameter GALFITM produces.


### galfitm-1.1.6

Fixed to behave when given multi-band data for which one of the images is highly (or even entirely) masked.  The masked data is simply ignored, as usual.  However, on entirely masked images, GALFITM used to crash during production of an internal sigma image (if required).  Now this crash is avoided, but a warning is output if the sky sigma is based on fewer than 100 unmasked pixels.

To help identify highly masked cases, I have added columns NGOOD and NMASK to the BAND_INFO table in the output fits file. These give the number of masked and unmasked pixels, respectively, for each band. So one could, e.g., identify images with more than half the pixels masked using NMASK > NGOOD.


### galfitm-1.1.5

Fixed a bug that was causing segfaults on 32-bit machines.  The 32-bit executable now actually works!


### galfitm-1.1.4

A few usage improvements:
   - Allow mixtures of specified and unspecified ("none") bad pixel masks and sigma images.
   - Output galfit.01 files can now be used to restart galfit
   - Updated help output (galfit -help)
   - Quits gracefully (no segfault) if a mask image is supplied which does not match the shape of the input image.


### galfitm-1.1.3

Fixes a	bug with input line length, and improve many-band stability.

Input lines were being clipped at 1000 characters, which was causing problems for people trying to fit many bands (and/or with long filenames).  This is now fixed.

Testing revealed that using full order with many bands the initial chebyshev was not well-representing the input parameter dependence on wavelength.  This appeared to be a problem with the polynomial spline fit that is used to initialise the chebyshev coefficients.  Changing to use cspline (which was already used for most other cases) appears to perform better, although the input values are still not perfectly recovered for large numbers of bands.  This has implications for the use of fit_flag=1 to fix the wavelength variation, but fit a constant offset (something I don't think many people are using as not really documented yet!).


### galfitm-1.1.2

A new version of GALFITM is available: 1.1.2.  This one is for those of you who want to fit a lot of images simultaneously.

It was noticed that previous versions were limited to fitting a maximum of 11 bands.  This was not done for any particular reason, the method is general for an arbitrary number of bands.  However, for very large numbers of bands, some minor changes to the memory management are required.  For now the maximum number has been increased to 5000, which should be plenty for the time being!

It was also noticed that recent versions used libraries that were compiled without full optimisation flags.  These flags are now enabled, so a small speed increase may be noticeable.


### galfitm-1.1.1

This version had a quickly discovered bug on linux, regarding the initialization of char arrays allocated on the heap instead of the stack.  It was therefore not distributed publicly.  See galfitm-1.1.2 for description of functional changes.


### galfitm-1.1.0

The only change is a tweak to the non-parametric method.  So, don't worry about upgrading if you aren't using that (highly experimental!) option.

More details… During the creation of the non-parametric image, a mask is applied to remove negative pixels and faint "ringing" features introduced buy the wavelet filtering.  Previously, when performing multi-band fitting with a non-parametric component, the same mask was always applied to all bands.  This is sensible when using SED homogenisation [i.e., "U) 1", which forces every pixel in the nonparam image to have the same SED], but is unnecessary when SED homogenisation is disabled [i.e. "U) -1"].  In this latter case the nonparam image is constructed for each band independently.  Now, in version 1.1.0, when SED homogenisation is turned off, the masking is done independently too.  Thanks to +Lee Kelvin and +Ulli Kuchner for highlighting this.


### galfitm-1.0.0

The first release of MegaMorph's GALFITM is now available!﻿




## GALAPAGOS

### Recent releases of GALAPAGOS

Please see the release notes on GitHub!


### galapagos-2.1.0

GALAPAGOS can now optionally take custom sigma images, for use in both the object detection with SExtractor and fitting with GALFIT.  The documentation has also improved.


### galapagos-2.0.6

A new version of GALAPAGOS, 2.0.6, is now on the MegaMorph webpage, including a new detailed README and examples.

In addition to the improved documentation, this version also includes two new features:
1) there is now an option for killing long running galfit processes after a user-specifiable time, and
2) we have introduced a batch mode that allows several machines to work on the same dataset as long as they see the same disk.﻿


### galapagos-2.0.5

The IDL code for our new version of GALAPAGOS (version 2.0.5) is now available from the project webpage.  As well as enabling multi-band fitting, the new version includes a host of additional features, such as spatially variable PSFs, and runs significantly faster.

Note that we plan to clean this code up a bit over the next couple of weeks and provide more documentation. So, keep an eye out for the announcement of version 2.0.6!﻿
